      This component features an animated curtain effect that dynamically opens
      and closes based on user interactions. Perfect for adding a dramatic
      reveal or a hidden content section to your web application.
    </p>
    <h3>How it works:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Click on the top or bottom section to open or close the curtain.</li>
      <li>
        The animation starts from the current position, ensuring a seamless
        transition between states.
      </li>
      <li>
        Both sections animate simultaneously to provide a synchronized visual
        effect.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Feel free to use this component and animation in your projects to create
      engaging user interfaces. We welcome you to customize and extend its
      functionality as needed!
